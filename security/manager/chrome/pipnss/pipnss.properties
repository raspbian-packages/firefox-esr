# The following strings have special requirements: they must fit in a 32 or 64
# bytes buffer after being encoded to UTF-8.
#
# It's possible to verify the length of a translation using the Browser Console
# in Firefox and evaluating the following code:
#
# (new TextEncoder('utf-8').encode('YOURSTRING')).length
#
# Simply replace YOURSTRING with your translation.
#
# If it's not possible to produce an understandable translation within these
# limits, keeping the English text is an acceptable workaround.
