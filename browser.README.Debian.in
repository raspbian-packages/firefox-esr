@Browser@ for Debian
====================

Please read the file /usr/share/bug/@browser@/presubj for information
you may want to know if you will report a bug.

Buttons
-------

Some people have complained that the button order in dialogs is
non-intuitive (ie, they don't like it). To reverse the order, add the
following to your chrome/userChrome.css file, under the
~/.mozilla/firefox directory:

.dialog-button-box { -moz-box-direction: reverse; -moz-box-pack: right; }
.dialog-button-box spacer { display: none ! important; }

Emacs keybindings
-----------------

Versions of Firefox before 1.0 supported Emacs style keybindings in
text entry boxes. Version 1.0 now merely follows the GTK keybindings
settings. To enable Emacs keybindings in GTK, follow the instructions
at http://kb.mozillazine.org/Emacs_Keybindings_(Firefox).

Well Known Ports
----------------

To prevent @Browser@ from being used to launch attacks against other
protocols, certain ports cannot be connected to by default. See
http://www.mozilla.org/projects/netlib/PortBanning.html for further
information. To allow the port numbers being used, enter
"about:config" in the URL bar and edit the
"network.security.ports.banned.override" entry to list the ports you
wish to allow (eg "2049,4045,6000").

Safe Browsing
-------------

Phishing and malware protection, also known as Safe Browsing, makes use
of a third party web service and regularly downloads updates. More
information on how this works and what is being sent and downloaded are
available on the following page:
http://www.mozilla.com/en-US/firefox/phishing-protection/

NTLM
----

Since version 30.0, NTLMv1 authentication has been disabled because
it's known as insecure. Companies and organizations still deploying
the older protocol should upgrade to NTLMv2, unfortunately, it's not
supported by iceweasel.
It is however still possible to toggle the preference to continue using
NTLMv1, though the NTLM auth support is considered deprecated, by
switching the network.negotiate-auth.allow-insecure-ntlm-v1 preference
in about:config.

See https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Firefox/Releases/30/Site_Compatibility#Security
for more details.
