"installation" ping
===================

This mobile-specific ping is intended to keep track of installs and Adjust attribution.

There should only be two installation pings sent, for different reasons:

* One sent immediately after the app start.
* One sent immediately after the Adjust attribution data becomes available.

If the app is later deleted and installed again, the Installation Pings must be send again.

Submission will be per the Edge server specification (legacy) and also use the unified telemetry version - 4::

    /submit/telemetry/docId/docType/appName/appVersion/appUpdateChannel/appBuildID/?v=4

* ``docId`` is a UUID for deduping
* ``docType`` is “installation”
* ``appName`` is “Fennec”
* ``appVersion`` is the version of the application (e.g. "68.0.0")
* ``appUpdateChannel`` is “release”, “beta”, etc.
* ``appBuildID`` is the build number
* ``v=4`` mandatory parameter for using unified telemetry
