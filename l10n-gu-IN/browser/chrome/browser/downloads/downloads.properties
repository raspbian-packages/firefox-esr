# LOCALIZATION NOTE (blockedMalware, blockedPotentiallyUnwanted,
#                    blockedUncommon2):
# These strings are shown in the panel for some types of blocked downloads, and
# are immediately followed by the "Learn More" link, thus they must end with a
# period.  You may need to adjust "downloadDetails.width" in "downloads.dtd" if
# this turns out to be longer than the other existing status strings.
# Note: These strings don't exist in the UI yet.  See bug 1053890.

# LOCALIZATION NOTE (statusSeparator, statusSeparatorBeforeNumber):
# These strings define templates for the separation of different elements in the
# status line of a download item.  As a separator, by default we use the Unicode
# character U+2014 'EM DASH' (long dash).  Examples of status lines include
# "Canceled - 222.net", "1.1 MB - website2.com", or "Paused -  1.1 MB".  Note
# that we use a wider space after the separator when it is followed by a number,
# just to avoid visually confusing it with with a minus sign with some fonts.
# If you use a different separator, this might not be necessary.  However, there
# is usually no need to change the separator or the order of the substitutions,
# even for right-to-left languages, unless the defaults are not suitable.
statusSeparator=%1$S — %2$S
statusSeparatorBeforeNumber=%1$S —  %2$S
